# OBJECTIVE

Based on the data AHS data available for the year 2012-2013, key
parameters have been chosen to categorise the districts.The goal is to
select socioeconomic parameters from the above data set, apply clustering
on the subset obtained and observe the characteristics of each clusters. On
the basis of that, observe which state affects what parameters the most
and the correlation between states with respect to these parameters.
The main objective can be decomposed into three smaller objectives:
 Preparing the data for clustering(choosing socioeconomic
parameters).
 Analysing the clusters formed for different number of centers.
 Deciding what number of clusters are best fit for the data set.
