# OBJECTIVE

Based on the data AHS data available for the year 2012-2013, key
parameters have been chosen to categorise the districts.The goal is to
select socioeconomic parameters from the above data set, apply clustering
on the subset obtained and observe the characteristics of each clusters. On
the basis of that, observe which state affects what parameters the most
and the correlation between states with respect to these parameters.
The main objective can be decomposed into three smaller objectives:
 Preparing the data for clustering(choosing socioeconomic
parameters).
 Analysing the clusters formed for different number of centers.
 Deciding what number of clusters are best fit for the data set.

# AHS DATASET

The dataset chosen for this particular assignment is the AHS
District-Wise key indicators for the year 2012-13.
AHS provides District-wise data on various parameters i.e. Sample
Particulars, Household Characteristics, Sex Ratio, Effective Literacy Rate,
Marriage, Schooling Status, Work Status, Disability, Injury, Acute Illness,
Chronic Illness, Fertility, Abortion, Family Planning Practices, Unmet
Need for Family Planning, Ante Natal Care, Delivery Care, Post Natal
Care, Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), Immunization, Vitamin A & Iron
Supplement and Birth Weight, Childhood Diseases, Breastfeeding and
Supplementation, Birth Registration, Awareness and Confidence Interval
(95%) for some important Indicators . The aim of the survey was to
provide feedback on the impact of the schemes under NHM in reduction
of Total Fertility Rate (TFR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) at the district
level and the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) at the regional level by
estimating these rates on an annual basis for around 284 districts in these
States.

#  HPD DATASET

The results obtained after clustering have been compared with the HPD
data available to see how many of the actual HPD districts have been
clustered correctly. The dataset used for this purpose is the List of High
priority districts identified by the Ministry of Health and Family welfare.
The original dataset contained 184 districts from all over the country, the
number of which has been reduced to 89 to make sure only those districts
remain that are part of EAGs.
The data refers to the List of High Priority Districts identified by the
Department of Health and Family Welfare for Implementation of focused
health care interventions under National Rural Health Mission. These
districts were identified based on DLHS indicators and also included
LWE districts- district with high percentage of SC/ST population etc.
Bottom 25% districts within a State taken according to raking based on
Composite Index plus LWE or Tribal districts falling in bottom 50%.
